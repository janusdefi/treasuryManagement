The AI Agent is an off-chain service that analyzes market conditions and protocol data to suggest optimal asset allocations.

Examples:

1. Collect Revenue:

await treasuryContract.collectRevenue(amount);


2. Allocate Asset:

await treasuryContract.allocateAsset(assetAddress, amount);


3. Rebalance Portfolio: The AI agent suggests rebalancing, and the protocol owner calls:

await treasuryContract.rebalancePortfolio();



Integration with the Janus Protocol

1. Flatcoin Support:

Fees collected in JFT can be reallocated to different assets.



2. Dynamic Reserves:

AI agents rebalance reserves based on inflation data, market conditions, and protocol goals.



3. Governance:

Treasury decisions, like AI agent selection or rebalancing rules, can be governed by token holders.
