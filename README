The AI Agent is an off-chain service that analyzes market conditions and protocol data to suggest optimal asset allocations.


Examples:

1. Collect Revenue:

await treasuryContract.collectRevenue(amount);


2. Allocate Asset:

await treasuryContract.allocateAsset(assetAddress, amount);


3. Rebalance Portfolio: The AI agent suggests rebalancing, and the protocol owner calls:

await treasuryContract.rebalancePortfolio();
